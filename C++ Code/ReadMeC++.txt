These files are from my intro to C++ class.
Lab 4 was on creating an implementation for a matrix in c++ as well as implementing functionality for matrix multiplication and matrix summation.
It also served as practice for overloading operators.

Lab 5 was on implementing a custom allocator to speed up performance vs a standard allocator.
I implemented this by using malloc and delete methods along with noexcept to slightly speed up my implementation.
