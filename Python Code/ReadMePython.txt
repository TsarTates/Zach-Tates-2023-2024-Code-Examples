These python code files are for a naive bayes implementation.
The regular naive bayes file is used to predict a label from a created classifyer using test data.
The improved naive bayes file takes the base naive bayes implementation and makes it predict a label 20% more acurately by using laplace smoothing to solve the zero-frequency problem.
